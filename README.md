# Digitalclock

We developed a responsive and creative digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies.

# How it works
* HTML sets up the basic structure, including a div element with a clock ID where the time will be displayed.
* CSS styles the div to make the clock look good on the webpage.
* JavaScript gets the current time, formats it to include leading zeros if needed, and updates the content of the clock div every second using the setInterval function.
  
When we were studying for a diploma we created this project.
