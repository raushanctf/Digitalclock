# Digitalclock

We developed a responsive and creative digital clock using  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# How it works
* HTML sets up the basic structure, including a div element with a clock ID where the time will be displayed.
* CSS styles the div to make the clock look good on the webpage.
* JavaScript gets the current time, formats it to include leading zeros if needed, and updates the content of the clock div every second using the setInterval function.
